# iris_classification

## Overview

This project is a simple machine learning model for classifying iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset used in this project is the famous Iris dataset, which is often used as a beginner's dataset in machine learning.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset used in this project contains four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and the target variable (species). The dataset is included in the `data` folder.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```
## Results

The trained model has achieved the following accurecies:
 linear SVC is 1.000, Poly SVC is 0.933 & Logistic Regression is 0.950

More details about the performance metrics can be found in the notebook or script.
